### Controllers
#### CoursesController
The CoursesController is a meticulously crafted component of our API, ensuring secure and efficient management of course data. With robust authentication, comprehensive error handling, and optimized data rendering, it provides a seamless experience for both users and developers. This controller exemplifies best practices in clean code and modular architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability for future growth.

#### MadrassasController
The MadrassasController efficiently manages madrassa data with a focus on secure access control and user-specific data filtering. It features actions for creating, updating, and deleting madrassas, with robust error handling and user-friendly feedback. The controller also provides specialized endpoints for retrieving madrassas based on region and listing classes within a madrassa, ensuring a tailored experience for different user roles.

### Helpers
#### StudentsHelper
The StudentsHelper module enhances the madrassa system by providing essential methods for managing student data and interactions. It offers utility functions for generating option lists and dynamically rendering form fields based on the student's subject. Additionally, it includes methods for displaying feedback options and integrates with Stimulus controllers to support responsive and interactive form elements. This helper ensures a streamlined, user-friendly experience for both teachers and students, making it easier to manage and update student information.

### Javascript
I will be covering Stimulus in this directory, as it is the default JavaScript framework in Rails 7.
#### ManagersController
This Stimulus controller enhances file input fields with image preview functionality. It listens for file changes to display selected images and manages the visibility of preview elements. On initialization, it shows existing images if available and hides placeholder elements. This ensures a seamless user experience when interacting with file uploads.

#### ScoresController
This Stimulus controller manages dynamic form updates for different subjects. It handles the display and input of specific fields based on the selected subject, ensuring that previously selected values are preserved and updated correctly. The controller also includes functionality to toggle additional feedback fields based on user selection.

### Models
#### Ability
The Ability class defines user permissions and access control within the application using CanCanCan. It assigns different levels of access based on user roles—Super Admin, Regional Admin, Head Teacher, and Teacher—ensuring that each user can perform actions relevant to their responsibilities. Super Admins have unrestricted access, while other roles have scoped permissions based on their associated region, madrassa, and role-specific limitations.

#### Course
This model class represents a course with various associations and functionalities. It supports attachments for images and registration forms, manages course registrations and user schedules, and tracks activities and attendances. Key features include scope-based queries for visibility and publication, validation for course names, and methods to determine user registration status and course progress. Notifications are sent to employees upon course creation, and the model also provides methods to fetch URLs for attachments and to determine the current stage of a user's progress in the course.

#### Student
This model class manages student data with best practices, including efficient associations, validations for essential attributes, and scopes for flexible querying. It leverages Active Storage for image uploads and integrates with S3 for secure file handling. Callbacks are used for managing related records and sending notifications, ensuring robust data integrity and automated updates.

### Services
#### AddressService
This class manages API requests to retrieve address data based on a postcode. It encapsulates API logic within a service object, ensuring separation of concerns. It uses environment variables for secure configuration of API URLs and tokens. The class handles errors by logging response issues, and parses the API response to construct and return complete address strings. This approach promotes secure, maintainable, and well-structured code.

#### Verify

The Twillio::Verify class handles Twilio verification by sending a code to a specified receiver, ensuring the number is formatted correctly. The call method checks the verification status and returns true if approved. It includes robust error handling: if an exception occurs, it logs the error message and returns false. This approach ensures secure verification while providing clear feedback on any issues encountered.

### Views

The student_listing.html.erb and _student_marks_form.html.erb files implement student listings with role-based filters, reusing code efficiently through partials and helpers. They use form_tag and select_tag for form creation, and options_from_collection_for_select for dropdowns. The files ensure role-specific filters are shown, adhere to best practices for DRY, and dynamically adjust URLs for filtering. Stimulus is managing interactive elements.

## Summary
This repository showcases well-structured code samples for a Rails application, following best practices and design patterns. The controllers manage course and madrassa data securely, with robust authentication and error handling. The helpers module enhances student data management, offering utility functions and integrating with Stimulus for responsive form elements. In javascript, Stimulus controllers provide dynamic image previews and form updates, ensuring a seamless user experience. The models utilize clean code practices, with Ability managing user permissions, Course handling course-related data, and Student ensuring robust data integrity and notifications. The services include AddressService for API interactions and Twillio::Verify for secure verification with error handling. The views implement role-based filters using partials and helpers, with Stimulus managing interactive elements. This setup emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and user-friendly design.
